Configuration
---
This bot script requires a configuration file named `keys.py`. Contained within the `keys.py` file, the authentication information for the Twitter app and Twitter account to be used are to be stored in a dictionary named `keys` of the following format:
```
keys = {
    consumer_token = "TOKEN",
    consumer_secret = "SECRET",
    access_key = "ACCESS_KEY",
    access_secret = "ACCESS_SECRET",
}
```
